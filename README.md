# Personal Website

I created this website using:

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   Typescript
-   Vite âš¡

Most of the projects present in this website will only be **placeholder** and will be replaced with actual projects (*when I have them*).

Making those placeholder project is a way for me to learn about **Web Development**. I will slowly add more and more "*project*" into the website as I find more interesting stuff to do regarding web development.

> More to be added!
